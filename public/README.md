Higher education institutions use different applications to manage their course offerings. Most of the large higher education institutions (universities or community colleges) build satellite campuses to offer convenient locations throughout the region they server. In a multi campus institutions, students may want to take classes offered at multiple campuses. The existing applications may help them if there is any schedule conflict in terms of time but they do not control if there is not enough time between classes located at different campuses. My app, University Mall, will help them not only to check for any time conflicts within the same campus but also at multiple campuses. The app will also display the routes for the day on google maps. For the purpose of demonstration, I have selected one of the largest community colleges in North Carolina which has multiple campuses.
In this app:
1)users will choose their role- student or instructor
2)if the user is a student, then the user will be able to:
a)enter their student id, first name, last name, the current semester
b)see their sections saved in cart, registered sections for the semester, registered sections for the day. The daily class schedules will be listed and displayed on google maps. The classes will be marked as A, B, .. on the map based on their sequence for the day.
c)search new classes, save the classes in cart, or register directly.
d)delete classes saved in cart, or drop registered classes (for the future, this can be enabled or disabled based on the start date of the class)
3)if the user is an instructor, then the user will be able to:
a)search for a student by entering student and class information.
b)able to enter grade and status of the class
